# hello-world
This is my first repository on github, I'm very excited
I'm 24 years old and these last days have been really nice because I'm starting to learn how to be a developer. I think this is the career I will found success. My mother tongue is portuguese from Brazil, but I'm trying to write everything in english cause I'm intenting to get used to the most used language in IT codes.
